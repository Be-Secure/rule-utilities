# Send Auth0 Failed Log Events to Slack

This guide explains how to use
[Auth0 Log Streaming](https://auth0.com/docs/logs/streams) to send specific
logged events to Slack. The events sent in this guide include all failures
(logins, signups, token exchange, etc.) and limits (rate limits, anomaly
detection, etc.).

The diagram above describes what you will build using this guide:

1. Application 1 and 2 both redirect to Auth0 to log in
2. The login for Application 2 succeeds but the login for Application 1 fails
3. Both events create a distinct log record
4. These log events are sent together in a JSON payload to the custom webhook
5. The webhook filters out the successful event
6. The webhook sends the failed event to Slack

See our
[Log Event Type Codes](https://auth0.com/docs/logs/references/log-event-type-codes)
reference for how to adjust the filter used here for different scenarios.

## What is Slack

Slack is a business communication platform that can be extended using custom
applications. Many companies, including Auth0, use Slack for general team
communication as well as a notification platform.

## Get started with Slack

Go to the [Slack API Applications section](https://api.slack.com/apps) and login
to your Slack account. Follow the
[Incoming Webhooks for Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-Webhooks-for-Slack)
guide to create a Slack endpoint that will accept the failed log events. Make
sure to leave your browser tab open or copy the URL provided as you'll need that
later in this guide.

## Deploy the webhook

The application in this repo is a simple Express API that provides a single
`/api/logs` route that accepts POST requests. If the request is formatted
properly, the log events for failures are parsed and sent to Slack.

To configure this application, you'll need the following environment variables:

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - This is the URL provided by Slack for your incoming
  webhook application.
- `AUTH0_LOG_STREAM_TOKEN` - Optional but recommended. This is a long, random
  string used to protect the endpoint from unauthorized requests. You will use
  this value in the Auth0 configuration steps below as well.

If you are testing this locally or hosting this endpoint yourself, these can be
saved in a `.env` file in the application's root directory. For hosting
providers like Heroku, Dokku, and similar, consult the platform's documentation
for the correct way to deploy these.

Once configured locally or deployed to your host, you can test the endpoint and
its connection to Slack with the following:

```bash
$ npm install # If running yourself
added XX packages from XX contributors in XX.XXs

$ npm start # If running yourself
Listening on port 3000

# Replace the Authorization header below
$ curl \
  --header "Authorization: AUTH0_LOG_STREAM_TOKEN_VALUE" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '[{"data": {"type": "f", "description": "Test failure", "client_id": "TestClientId", "client_name": "Test Client Name", "log_id": "abc1234567890"}}]' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/logs
ok
```

The `ok` above signals that the request was accepted and processed correctly. In
Slack, you should see the following message in the channel you configured:

## Configure an Auth0 log stream

The final step is to configure Auth0 to send log events to this webhook using an
HTTP event stream.

Follow [the instructions here](https://auth0.com/docs/logs/streams/http-event)
to create a new stream pointing to your deployed Express application. The field
values to use are:

- **Payload URL** - URL to your deployed webhook like
  `https://[host domain]/api/logs`
- **Authorization Token** - value configured above
- **Content Type** - use "application/json"
- **Content Format** - use "JSON Array"

Once this is saved, your log stream is ready to use. To test, you'll need to
trigger a failing log event. The simplest way to do that is to attempt to login
with an incorrect email or password. If the stream is configured correctly, you
should see a Slack message saying:

> Wrong email or password. [type: fu]

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing the Slack message appear after several seconds, you'll need
to walk down the same path a log event would:

1. First, check the Dashboard **Logs > Search** screen to make sure the record
   is there.
2. Then, check the **Health** tab for the stream
   ([more information here](https://auth0.com/docs/logs/streams/http-event#delivery-attempts-and-retries)).
3. If the webhook delivery is succeeding, check the logs for your deployed
   application to see if anything is going wrong there.
